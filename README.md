Text transformer bot for Telegram
---------------------------------

A simple Telegram bot for transforming text. It can:

    - s p a c e   t h e   t e x t   o u t
    - prooooloooong theeee vooooweeeels
    - MaKe A fEnCe OuT oF yOuR mEsSaGe

and more.

I've done this mainly to get started with Rust and picked rewriting an already existing bot into Rust to get some feel of the language.

The bot is running at [@txtorbot](https://t.me/txtorbot). If you want to host it yourself, install Rust compiler using `rustup` or through other means, compile the project using `cargo build`, set the `TELOXIDE_TOKEN` environment variable to your bot token and run the program.
